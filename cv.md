####  About me:  
I want to develop in the field of programming. At this stage, I am interested in web programming.
I do not have work experience. Now my priority is to get enough knowledge to find a job, as well as to develop myself.
I am a purposeful and responsible person, I like to learn something new and interesting to me, I quickly master the material and try to help others.

####  Skills:  
* HTML
* CSS
* JS(NodeJS) (basic)
* C++ (basic)
* VB
* MathLab

####  My code:
  
```js
function fizzbuzz(n)
{
  let arr = [];
  for (let i=0; i<n;i++)
    {
      arr[i] = i+1;
       if (arr[i]%3==0 && arr[i]%5 == 0)
        arr[i]="FizzBuzz"
      if (arr[i]%3==0)
        arr[i]="Fizz"
       if (arr[i]%5==0)
        arr[i]="Buzz"
    }
  return arr;
}
```

```c++
DWORD WINAPI fThread1(LPVOID)
{
	srand(time_t(NULL));
	rand();
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
	{
		arr[i] = rand() * 500 / (RAND_MAX)+0;
		cout << "arr[" << i << "] = " << arr[i] << endl;
		ReleaseSemaphore(hSemaphore, 1, NULL);
		Sleep(500);
	}
	return 0;
}
```
